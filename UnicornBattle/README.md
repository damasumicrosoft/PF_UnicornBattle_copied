## Configuration and Setup
### Prerequisites:
This is an advanced example and can be quite dense at times due to the many sub-systems. 

- You should be very familiar with Unity3d & UUI 
- Have a basic understanding of the PlayFab Unity SDK and API
- Be comfortable working with JSON-to-C# serialization & deserialization

#### Client Setup:
The [Unicorn Battle Client](/UnicornBattle/ "Unity Project") was built with iOS and Android targets using Unity3d 5.3.4f. Testing within the Unity editor, on web or desktop works, but not all features are available. This game was designed to be viewed in 16:9 aspect ratio, but most common ratios should display reasonably well. 

Prior to running Unicorn Battle you will need to set your TitleId in GlobalStrings.cs. This is the same value you used when setting up the back-end.

At this point you should be at a point where you can build and test the game locally.
